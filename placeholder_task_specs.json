    "spec": "Evaluate the subject placement and balance of the cat within the photograph. Examine where the cat is positioned relative to the boundaries of the frame and determine whether that placement feels purposeful or arbitrary.\n\nA well-placed cat feels settled in the composition — it belongs where it is, whether centered or off to one side, because the position creates a sense of visual equilibrium. When a cat is placed dead center, the image should feel calm and symmetrical, like a formal portrait. When placed off-center, there should be a compositional reason — a counterbalancing element, a directional gaze, or a sense of movement that justifies the asymmetry.\n\nScore highly when the cat's position feels like a deliberate decision — when the viewer's eye lands on the cat and senses that this is exactly where it was meant to land, and that shifting it in any direction would make the image feel less right.\n\nScore poorly when the cat feels abandoned by the frame: shoved into a corner with no compositional logic, pressed against an edge as if the photographer almost missed it, floating in a vast emptiness that diminishes its presence, or awkwardly cropped at the boundaries in a way that feels careless rather than artistic.\n\nThis is not about following rigid positional rules. A cat dead center scores beautifully if the frame supports it. A cat along a dynamic diagonal scores just as well if the balance holds. What matters is whether the cat's position within the frame feels like a decision, not an accident.",

    "spec": "Evaluate the effective use of surrounding space in the cat photograph. Assess the space around the cat — the negative space, background, and environment — and determine whether it serves the subject or works against it.\n\nThe cat should be given an appropriate amount of room. Too little space — an aggressive crop that carelessly slices through ears, paws, or tail without artistic justification — makes the image feel claustrophobic and careless. Too much space — a tiny cat lost in an ocean of empty floor or sky — makes the subject feel insignificant, like a footnote in its own photograph. The ideal is a spatial relationship where the cat feels prominent without feeling cramped, where the environment provides context or atmosphere without overwhelming the subject.\n\nBeyond the amount of space, consider whether the surrounding area supports or competes with the cat. A busy background full of competing objects can fragment the viewer's focus, stealing attention from the subject. A clean or softly rendered background lets the cat command the frame. However, cleanliness alone is not the standard — a richly detailed environment can work beautifully if it is organized in a way that still directs attention inward toward the cat.\n\nScore highly when the cat feels prominent without feeling cramped and the surrounding space cooperates with the subject — when the environment provides context or atmosphere while still letting the cat be the clear focal point.\n\nScore poorly when the space overwhelms the cat, making it feel insignificant; when it crowds the cat with careless cropping; or when it distracts from the cat with cluttered, competing elements that fragment the viewer's attention.",

    "spec": "Evaluate the compositional flow toward the subject in the cat photograph. Determine whether the visual structure of the image — its lines, shapes, edges, boundaries, and spatial cues — guides the viewer's eye toward the cat, making it the natural destination of the gaze.\n\nLook for visual pathways that lead to the subject. These might be literal leading lines — a fence, a path, a row of books on a shelf — that point toward the cat. They might be natural frames — a doorway, a window frame, an arch of branches — that enclose the cat and focus attention. They might be subtler cues: a gradient of light that brightens toward the cat, a pattern of shapes that converges on the subject, or a contrast in texture or sharpness that makes the cat the most visually compelling element in the scene.\n\nScore highly when the eye arrives at the cat naturally and effortlessly, as if the entire visual world of the photograph was arranged to deliver the viewer to its subject. The presence of leading lines, natural frames, light gradients, or converging geometry that points inward toward the cat all contribute to strong compositional flow.\n\nScore poorly when lines and shapes lead the eye away from the cat — toward a bright window in the background, a bold pattern on the floor, or an open doorway that pulls attention out of the frame. Score poorly when competing focal points fracture the viewer's attention, or when the absence of any guiding structure leaves the viewer's gaze wandering aimlessly with no clear path to the subject.",
