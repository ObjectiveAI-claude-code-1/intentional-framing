    "spec": "Evaluate the placement and balance of the cat within the frame. Determine where the cat is positioned relative to the boundaries of the photograph and assess whether that position feels purposeful and visually balanced. A cat placed with care — whether centered with quiet symmetry or offset with dynamic tension — should create the impression that it belongs exactly where it is. Consider whether the visual weight of the cat and the visual weight of the surrounding space are in dialogue, producing a sense of compositional wholeness. Reject placements that feel accidental: a cat awkwardly cropped at an edge, crammed into a corner without justification, or marooned in an undifferentiated expanse of empty space. The goal is to determine whether the cat's position within the rectangle of the image feels chosen — as though this placement, among all possible placements, is the one that makes the photograph feel complete. Score high when the cat's placement radiates intentionality and the frame feels built around it. Score low when the cat's position feels arbitrary, careless, or like the subject could have been anywhere without the composition changing.",

    "spec": "Assess the effective use of surrounding space relative to the cat. Examine the relationship between the subject and the environment that frames it, asking whether the space around the cat plays a supporting role or competes with it. In strong compositions, the surrounding area gives the cat room to breathe — providing context like a sunlit floor, a rumpled blanket, or a stretch of open sky — without overwhelming the subject or stealing focus. The background should recede while the cat advances; there should be a clear visual hierarchy with the cat at its apex. Identify problems such as backgrounds so busy and cluttered that the eye has nowhere to rest, frames so wide that the cat is dwarfed into insignificance, or crops so tight that the cat feels trapped against the borders of the image. The goal is to judge whether the proportion of the frame allocated to the subject versus everything else feels natural and inevitable — whether the cat has been given exactly the space it needs, no more and no less. Score high when the surrounding space supports the cat without competing, creating a sense that the frame could not have been drawn any other way. Score low when the environment overwhelms, suffocates, or marginalizes the subject.",

    "spec": "Determine whether the visual elements of the photograph create compositional flow toward the cat. Trace the paths the viewer's eye would naturally follow through the image — paths shaped by lines, edges, contrasts, light gradients, and areas of visual interest — and assess whether those paths converge on the cat. Look for leading lines such as floorboards angling inward, shelves or surfaces terminating at the subject, or light brightening toward the cat's face that create a sense of compositional inevitability — a feeling that every element in the photograph is quietly pointing at the subject. Identify cases where the flow works against the subject: the eye drifting to a bright window in a corner, following a diagonal that leads away from the cat, or bouncing between competing focal points with no resolution. The goal is to determine whether the visual architecture of the photograph — its geometry, tonal structure, and arrangement of shapes — generates a current that draws the viewer naturally and effortlessly toward the cat, making it not just present in the image but central to its visual gravity. Score high when lines, light, and spatial geometry converge on the cat with a feeling of inevitability. Score low when the eye wanders, is pulled away from the subject, or finds no coherent path toward the cat.",
