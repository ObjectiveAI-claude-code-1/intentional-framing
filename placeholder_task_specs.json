    "spec": "Evaluate the subject placement and balance of the cat within the photograph. Examine where the cat sits within the boundaries of the frame and determine whether that placement creates a sense of visual balance and purposeful anchoring.\n\nThe cat does not need to be centered or conform to any particular geometric rule — what matters is that its position feels chosen rather than accidental. A cat resting in the lower third of a tall frame can feel perfectly balanced if the space above it serves the composition. A cat pressed against the left edge can feel intentional if the space to the right tells part of the story. What matters is that the placement creates stability and focus.\n\nScore low when the cat is awkwardly cropped at the limbs, shoved into a margin as though the photographer barely noticed it, or lost without any spatial intention. Score high when the cat's position — wherever it may be in the frame — feels deliberate and balanced, occupying its space with quiet authority rather than floating aimlessly or being crammed into a corner.\n\nThis is not about enforcing rigid compositional rules. It is about whether the cat's position within the frame feels like it was decided, not defaulted to — whether the placement itself communicates purpose.",

    "spec": "Evaluate the effective use of surrounding space in the cat photograph. Look outward from the cat to the space that surrounds it and assess whether that space serves the subject as a compositional tool.\n\nSurrounding space — often called negative space — is not emptiness. It is context, breathing room, and the visual quiet that allows the cat to stand out. When surrounding space is used effectively, the cat feels neither crowded nor lost. The background complements the subject rather than competing with it.\n\nA busy environment can still score well if the space immediately around the cat offers enough separation to keep the subject distinct. A minimal environment can score poorly if there is so much emptiness that the cat becomes a speck, dwarfed by its own frame. Consider whether the proportional relationship between the cat and its environment feels purposeful — whether the surrounding space was shaped to support the subject or was simply whatever happened to be there.\n\nScore high when the space around the cat functions as a deliberate compositional element — giving the subject room to breathe while keeping it prominent and distinct. Score low when the cat is either suffocated by clutter with no visual separation, or diminished into insignificance by an overwhelming expanse of environment that makes the cat feel like an afterthought.",

    "spec": "Evaluate the compositional flow toward the subject in the cat photograph. Assess whether the visual structure of the image — its lines, shapes, edges, light, and geometry — guides the viewer's eye toward the cat.\n\nPhotographs are not experienced all at once; the eye travels through them, following paths created by the elements within the frame. Compositional flow is the sense that the image has a current, and that current leads to the subject. A doorframe might create a natural border that focuses attention inward. A line of fence posts might lead diagonally toward the cat. A patch of light might fall precisely where the cat rests, pulling the gaze like gravity. Even subtle flow — the gentle curve of a blanket, a soft gradient of light across a floor — can draw the eye with quiet effectiveness.\n\nScore high when the viewer's eye arrives at the cat almost without effort, as though the visual architecture of the image was built to deliver them there. The composition moves toward the cat, whether through dramatic leading lines, natural framing elements, light placement, or subtle geometric cues. Score low when the eye wanders without direction, distracted by competing visual elements, confused by chaotic geometry, or simply left without a path to the subject. What matters is whether the composition moves toward the cat, not away from it.",
