1. Evaluate the cat's placement within the frame and the visual balance of the composition. Determine whether the cat's position relative to the edges of the image feels purposeful and anchored — as though the subject belongs exactly where it sits — or whether it feels accidental, adrift, or uncomfortable. Assess whether the visual weight of the cat and its surroundings is distributed in a way that creates a sense of compositional equilibrium, whether through symmetry, counterbalance, or purposeful tension. The cat may be centered, off-center, near an edge, or anywhere else within the frame; no placement is inherently better than another. What matters is whether the specific placement in this specific photograph creates a feeling of rightness and intention rather than randomness or unease.

2. Evaluate how effectively the space surrounding the cat serves the subject. Assess everything in the photograph that is not the cat — the negative space, the background, the environment — and determine whether it supports or undermines the subject. Consider whether the cat is given an appropriate amount of room: enough space to breathe without being dwarfed or lost in a vast, purposeless expanse, and enough closeness to feel present without being cramped, crowded, or uncomfortably cropped. Consider whether the surrounding elements provide helpful context or atmosphere, or whether they introduce clutter, distraction, and visual noise that compete with the cat for the viewer's attention. The ideal surrounding space works in the cat's favor — framing, supporting, and complementing the subject the way a setting frames a jewel.

3. Evaluate the degree to which the visual elements within the photograph guide the viewer's eye toward the cat. Assess whether the lines, shapes, tonal contrasts, natural boundaries, and spatial relationships present in the image create a visual current that converges on the subject. Leading lines such as edges, pathways, or architectural features may point toward the cat. Frames-within-frames created by doorways, arches, or gaps between objects may isolate and emphasize it. Contrast between the cat and its background may naturally draw the eye. Environmental geometry may culminate at the subject. Determine whether these visual currents, in whatever form they take, work in the cat's favor — delivering the viewer's eye to the subject naturally and letting it settle there — or whether the eye is led elsewhere, scattered without direction, or drawn to competing elements that make the cat feel incidental.
