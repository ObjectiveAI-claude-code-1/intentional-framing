    "spec": "Evaluate the cat's placement within the frame and the visual balance of the composition. Score how purposeful and anchored the cat's position feels relative to the edges of the image.\n\nConsider whether the cat is positioned with a sense of rightness — as though it belongs exactly where it sits — or whether it feels accidental, adrift, or uncomfortable. A poorly placed cat may be shoved into a corner with no compositional rationale, awkwardly bisected by an edge, or marooned in a sea of irrelevant space. A well-placed cat feels anchored, as though the image would suffer if the subject were anywhere else.\n\nAssess whether the visual weight of the cat and its surroundings is distributed in a way that creates compositional equilibrium — whether through symmetry, counterbalance, or purposeful tension. An off-center cat can feel perfectly balanced if the surrounding space provides a counterweight. A centered cat can feel perfectly balanced through simplicity and directness.\n\nNo placement is inherently better than another. Center placement works beautifully for direct, confrontational portraits. Off-center placement can create dynamism and narrative. A cat near an edge can feel like it is about to enter or leave the scene. The question is always whether the specific placement in this specific photograph creates a feeling of intentional rightness rather than randomness or visual unease.\n\nThis evaluation is not about checking adherence to compositional rules like the rule of thirds. It is about whether the placement feels deliberate and whether the overall balance of the image feels purposeful.",

    "spec": "Evaluate how effectively the space surrounding the cat serves the subject. Score whether the negative space, background, and environment in the photograph support and complement the cat, or whether they undermine it.\n\nConsider whether the cat is given an appropriate amount of room. Too much empty space dwarfs the cat, making it feel insignificant within its own photograph — the viewer's eye wanders with nothing to anchor it, and the cat becomes a small detail in a large, purposeless expanse. Too little space creates the opposite problem: the cat feels cramped, crowded, or uncomfortably cropped, as though the frame is pressing in on the subject rather than containing it.\n\nAssess whether the surrounding elements provide helpful context or atmosphere — a windowsill, a garden, a cozy blanket — or whether they introduce clutter, distraction, and visual noise that compete with the cat for the viewer's attention. Cluttered space filled with competing objects or busy patterns fragments the image's coherence and pulls focus away from the subject.\n\nThe ideal surrounding space works in the cat's favor, the way a setting frames a jewel. It supports, complements, and enhances the subject. The space does not need to be beautiful or interesting in itself — it needs to serve the cat. A plain wall can be excellent negative space. A lush garden can provide rich atmosphere. What matters is whether the relationship between the cat and its surrounding space feels purposeful and supportive rather than overwhelming, distracting, or suffocating.",

    "spec": "Evaluate the degree to which the visual elements within the photograph guide the viewer's eye toward the cat. Score whether the lines, shapes, tonal contrasts, natural boundaries, and spatial relationships present in the image create a visual current that converges on the subject.\n\nConsider whether leading lines — such as edges, pathways, fences, rows of objects, or architectural features — point toward the cat. Consider whether natural boundaries like doorframes, archways, windows, or gaps between objects create a frame-within-a-frame that isolates and emphasizes the subject. Consider whether tonal contrast between the cat and its background naturally draws the eye to the point of greatest visual difference — a dark cat against a light background, or a sunlit cat within a shadowy room. Consider whether the geometry of the environment culminates at the subject — a circular rug ringing the cat, a triangular arrangement of objects pointing toward it, a diagonal shadow terminating where the cat sits.\n\nIn a photograph with strong compositional flow, the viewer's eye arrives at the cat naturally and settles there with satisfaction. The image feels cohesive — every element participates in a visual narrative that converges on the subject. In a photograph with weak or absent flow, the eye bounces around the frame without direction, or is drawn to competing elements that make the cat feel incidental. The photograph feels scattered, and the cat feels like an afterthought.\n\nThis evaluation is about whether the visual currents in the image, whatever form they take, are working in the cat's favor — delivering the viewer's attention to the subject and letting it rest there.",
