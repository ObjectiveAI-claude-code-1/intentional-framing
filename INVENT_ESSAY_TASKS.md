1. Evaluate subject placement and balance. Examine where the cat is positioned within the boundaries of the frame and determine whether that placement feels purposeful or arbitrary. A well-placed cat feels settled in the composition — it belongs where it is, whether that is dead center or off to one side, because the position creates a sense of visual equilibrium. Score poorly when the cat feels abandoned by the frame: shoved into a corner with no compositional logic, pressed against an edge as if nearly missed, or adrift in a vast emptiness that diminishes its presence. Score well when the cat's position feels like a deliberate decision — when the viewer's eye lands on the cat and senses that this is exactly where it was meant to land, and that shifting it in any direction would make the image feel less right.

2. Evaluate effective use of surrounding space. Assess the space around the cat — the negative space, background, and environment — and determine whether it serves the subject or works against it. The cat should be given an appropriate amount of room: too little space, such as an aggressive crop that carelessly slices through ears, paws, or tail, makes the image feel claustrophobic; too much space, with a tiny cat lost in an ocean of empty floor or sky, makes the subject feel insignificant. Beyond the amount of space, consider whether the surrounding area supports or competes with the cat. A busy background full of competing objects can fragment the viewer's focus, while a clean or well-organized environment lets the cat command the frame. Score well when the cat feels prominent without feeling cramped and the surrounding space cooperates with the subject. Score poorly when the space overwhelms, crowds, or distracts from the cat.

3. Evaluate compositional flow toward the subject. Determine whether the visual structure of the image — its lines, shapes, edges, boundaries, and spatial cues — guides the viewer's eye toward the cat. Look for visual pathways that lead to the subject: leading lines such as a fence, a path, or a row of objects that point inward; natural frames such as doorways, window frames, or arches of branches that enclose the cat; and subtler cues such as gradients of light that brighten toward the cat, converging patterns, or contrasts in texture that make the cat the most visually compelling element. Score well when the eye arrives at the cat naturally and effortlessly, as if the entire visual world of the photograph was arranged to deliver the viewer to its subject. Score poorly when lines and shapes lead the eye away from the cat, when competing focal points pull attention elsewhere, or when the absence of any guiding structure leaves the viewer's gaze wandering aimlessly.
