1. Evaluate subject placement and balance. Examine where the cat is positioned within the frame and determine whether that placement feels purposeful. Consider whether the cat anchors the composition with a clear center of gravity — whether the viewer immediately understands where to look. Assess the visual equilibrium between the cat and the surrounding space: the cat should not be crammed against an edge, awkwardly bisected by the frame boundary, or marooned in emptiness without compositional reason. Strong placement means the cat occupies its position with a sense of belonging, as though the frame was drawn around it. Weak placement makes the cat feel accidental — technically present but compositionally absent.

2. Evaluate spatial harmony between the cat and its environment. Examine the relationship between the cat and the space around it — the negative space, background elements, and foreground objects — and determine whether that relationship serves the subject. The cat should be given room to breathe without being dwarfed or diminished by its surroundings. Background elements should feel like they belong to the same visual story as the cat rather than competing with it for attention. Assess whether the space acts as a stage for the subject or as a distraction from it. Poor spatial harmony manifests as backgrounds that overwhelm the cat, framing so tight the subject feels claustrophobic, or emptiness so vast the cat feels abandoned.

3. Evaluate compositional flow toward the cat. Examine whether the visual structure of the image — its lines, shapes, boundaries, and tonal contrasts — creates pathways that guide the viewer's eye toward the cat. Look for leading lines, natural frames, pools of light, gradients of focus, or arrangements of shapes that funnel attention inward toward the subject. What matters is the cumulative effect: whether the image feels like it has a visual current that carries the viewer toward the cat effortlessly and inevitably. When compositional flow is absent, the eye wanders without direction, and the cat must compete for the attention it should naturally command as the subject of the photograph.
