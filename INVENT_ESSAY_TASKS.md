1. Evaluate subject placement and balance. Examine where the cat sits within the boundaries of the frame and determine whether that placement creates a sense of visual balance and purposeful anchoring. The cat does not need to be centered or conform to any geometric rule — what matters is that its position feels chosen rather than accidental. Consider whether the cat occupies its space with quiet authority, neither crammed awkwardly into a corner nor floating aimlessly in emptiness. Assess whether the placement creates stability and focus, and whether the cat's position within the frame feels like it was decided, not defaulted to. A cat that is awkwardly cropped at the limbs, shoved into a margin, or lost without spatial intention should score low; a cat whose position — wherever it may be — feels deliberate and balanced should score high.

2. Evaluate effective use of surrounding space. Look outward from the cat to the space that surrounds it and assess whether that space serves the subject as a compositional tool. Surrounding space is not emptiness — it is context, breathing room, and the visual quiet that allows the cat to stand out. Determine whether the cat feels neither crowded nor lost, and whether the background complements rather than competes with the subject. A busy environment can still be effective if the space immediately around the cat offers enough separation to keep it distinct, while a minimal environment can fail if so much emptiness dwarfs the cat into insignificance. This task evaluates the relationship between the cat and everything that is not the cat — whether the surrounding space was shaped to support the subject or was simply whatever happened to be there.

3. Evaluate compositional flow toward the subject. Assess whether the visual structure of the image — its lines, shapes, edges, light, and geometry — guides the viewer's eye toward the cat. Consider how the eye travels through the photograph and whether the elements within the frame create paths that lead naturally to the subject. This flow may be dramatic, such as a doorframe that borders attention inward or a line of objects leading diagonally to the cat, or it may be subtle, such as a gentle curve of fabric or a soft gradient of light across a surface. What matters is whether the composition moves toward the cat rather than away from it. When flow is weak, the eye wanders without direction, distracted by competing elements or left without a path. When flow is strong, the viewer arrives at the cat almost without effort, as though the visual architecture of the image was built to deliver them there.
