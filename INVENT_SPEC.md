Evaluate the intentional framing of the cat photograph. Score how deliberate and effective the composition feels — whether the cat is positioned within the frame in a way that naturally draws the viewer's eye toward it, and whether the spatial arrangement of elements serves the cat as the focal point.

Consider the following factors when scoring:

- Is the cat positioned purposefully within the frame, or does it feel randomly placed — shoved into a corner, awkwardly cropped at the edges, or lost in a vast expanse of empty space?
- Do leading lines, natural boundaries, or environmental geometry guide the viewer's eye inward toward the cat?
- Does the overall arrangement of elements feel balanced and purposeful, or chaotic and accidental?
- Is there a sense of visual order — a feeling that the composition, whether planned or serendipitous, works in the cat's favor?
- Does the photograph feel like a portrait of a cat, or merely an image that happens to contain one?

Strong intentional framing means the spatial relationship between the cat and its surrounding space serves the subject. The cat is given room to breathe but is not dwarfed by its environment. The composition works with the subject rather than against it. Weak framing makes the cat feel like an afterthought — the background dominates, the cat is marginal, or the crop disrupts the viewer's ability to appreciate the subject.

This evaluation is not about following rigid compositional rules like the rule of thirds. A cat sitting dead center in a simple frame can score beautifully. A cat caught along a dynamic diagonal can score just as well. What matters is whether the framing feels like it was made for this cat in this moment — whether the viewer senses that the image was composed around its subject.

When inventing sub-functions for this task, each sub-function should evaluate a specific dimension of compositional framing — such as subject placement and balance, effective use of surrounding space, or compositional flow toward the subject. Each sub-function receives the same cat photograph as input.
