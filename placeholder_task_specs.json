    "spec": "Evaluate subject placement and balance within the cat photograph. Examine where the cat is positioned within the frame and determine whether that placement feels purposeful and deliberate. Consider whether the cat anchors the composition with a clear center of gravity — whether the viewer immediately understands where to look. Assess the visual equilibrium between the cat and the surrounding space: the cat should not be crammed against an edge, awkwardly bisected by the frame boundary, or marooned in emptiness without compositional reason. Strong placement means the cat occupies its position with a sense of belonging, as though the frame was drawn around it. Weak placement makes the cat feel accidental — technically present but compositionally absent. This is not about following rigid rules like the rule of thirds. A cat sitting dead center in a quiet frame can feel profoundly intentional. What matters is whether the placement feels chosen.",

    "spec": "Evaluate spatial harmony between the cat and its environment in the photograph. Examine the relationship between the cat and the space around it — the negative space, background elements, and foreground objects — and determine whether that relationship serves the subject. The cat should be given room to breathe without being dwarfed or diminished by its surroundings. Negative space should feel purposeful — existing to frame, cushion, or stage the cat rather than to overwhelm or abandon it. Background elements should feel like they belong to the same visual story as the cat rather than competing with it for the viewer's attention. Poor spatial harmony manifests as backgrounds that overwhelm the subject with busy textures or dominant shapes, framing so tight the cat feels claustrophobic, or emptiness so vast the cat feels abandoned. Strong spatial harmony means the environment acts as a stage for the cat — space that serves the subject rather than working against it.",

    "spec": "Evaluate compositional flow toward the cat in the photograph. Examine whether the visual structure of the image — its lines, shapes, boundaries, and tonal contrasts — creates pathways that guide the viewer's eye toward the cat. Look for leading lines, natural frames such as doorways or arches, pools of light isolating the subject, gradients of focus that sharpen at the cat, tonal shifts that make the subject pop against its background, or arrangements of shapes that funnel attention inward. What matters is the cumulative effect: whether the image feels like it has a visual current that carries the viewer toward the cat effortlessly and inevitably. Strong compositional flow means the viewer's eye arrives at the subject without effort, as though the image was designed to deliver them there. When compositional flow is absent, the eye bounces around the frame without direction, and the cat must compete for the attention it should naturally command as the subject of the photograph.",
